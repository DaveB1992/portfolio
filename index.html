        <section>
            <p>My name is Dave, I am 30 years old and currently live in Northwich, UK.</p>
            <p>I got into coding through working in the mobile phones industry. I would repair and fix mobile phones and
                apps,
                which prompted my <br> interest in tech.
                I went down the rabbit hole of how apps were built and looked into coding. I then started to do some
                self-taught bits and recently started the Command Shift bootcamp to really push my skills and become job
                ready <br>
                The wage potential, flexibility and the oppurtunities surrounding tech were also a huge pull for me.</p>
